# AIML-Project-Series-1

Sorry for late submission bcz of my sem.

1st project

basic_Chatbot1.py, intents.json

error handling Chatbot: I don't know the answer. Can you teach me? Type the answer or "skip" to skip: The current error handling approach prompts the user to provide an answer even if they choose to skip, leading to a potential waste of effort if the answer is not saved in the dataset. To enhance error handling and prevent this waste, we need to adjust the code to handle the "skip" option more effectively.
